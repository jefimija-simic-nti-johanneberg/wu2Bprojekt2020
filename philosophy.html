            <p class="filosofitext litentext">Philosophy of Art The definition of art has been debated for centuries among philosophers.”What is art?” is the
                most basic question in the philosophy of aesthetics, which really means, “How do we determine what is defined
                as art?” This implies two subtexts: the essential nature of art, and its social importance (or lack of it).
                The definition of art has generally fallen into three categories: representation, expression, and form.</article>

        <article class="filosofi2">
            <p class="filosofitext">According to H.W Janson, author of the classic art textbook, The History of Art, “...we cannot escape viewing
                works of art in the context of time and circumstance, whether past or present. How indeed could it be otherwise,
                so long as art is still being created all around us, opening our eyes almost daily to new experiences and
                thus forcing us to adjust our sights?” Throughout the centuries in Western culture from the 11th century
                on through the end of the 17th century, the definition of art was anything done with skill as the result
                of knowledge and practice. This meant that artists honed their craft, learning to replicate their subjects
                skillfully. The epitome of this occurred during the Dutch Golden Age when artists were free to paint in all
                sorts of different genres and made a living off their art in the robust economic and cultural climate of
                17th century Netherlands. During the Romantic period of the 18th century, as a reaction to the Enlightenment
                and its emphasis on science, empirical evidence, and rational thought, art began to be described as not just
                being something done with skill, but something that was also created in the pursuit of beauty and to express
                the artist’s emotions. Nature was glorified, and spirituality and free expression were celebrated. Artists,
                themselves, achieved a level of notoriety and were often guests of the aristocracy. The Avant-garde art movement
                began in the 1850s with the realism of Gustave Courbet. It was followed by other modern art movements such
                as cubism, futurism, and surrealism, in which the artist pushed the boundaries of ideas and creativity. These
                represented innovative approaches to art-making and the definition of what is art expanded to include the
                idea of the originality of vision. The idea of originality in art persists, leading to ever more genres and
                manifestations of art, such as digital art, performance art, conceptual art, environmental art, electronic
                art, etc.
